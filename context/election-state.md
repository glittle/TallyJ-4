# Election State Management & Teller Coordination

## Status: active
## Evidence: confirmed (issue #172)

“Move all tellers to this state” and related coordination must be reliable. Multi-teller environments are the normal real-world case, not an edge case.

### Why it matters
State transitions affect what every teller can see and do. Silent or partial failures create inconsistent views across machines and can lead to divergent ballot sets.

### Design posture
Treat state changes as high-consequence operations. Prefer clear, atomic transitions and strong feedback over optimistic updates.
